                Grace Community Church was founded in 1995 with a simple but powerful vision: to create 
                a place where people could experience God's unconditional love and find their purpose in life. 
                What started as a small gathering of families has grown into a thriving community of believers 
                from all walks of life.

                Over the years, we've remained committed to our core values of faith, fellowship, and service. 
                We've seen countless lives transformed, families restored, and communities impacted through 
                the work we do together. Our church is more than a building â€“ it's a family united by our 
                shared love for God and each other.
